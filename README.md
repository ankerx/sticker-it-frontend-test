# The Task

Using the wireframes we've provided try to to create the menu for both mobile
and desktop. We don't expect you to be able to create everything to pixel
perfection in the allocated time

# What you'd do if you had more time

I would:

improve mobile version

split components into smaller to make code more readable

write better stories

# What design or UX improvements you'd make?

I think I would make the dropdown "About" a little big bigger

I don't know if the dropdowns are showing on hover or if it's like that just in Adobe, but if so - I think it can be a little annoying for the user.

Increase the contrast of Support and About buttons
